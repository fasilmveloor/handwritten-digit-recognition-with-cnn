# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Network

![Cover](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jlxdirCP5Qre1pcoNC-7JQ.png)

Handwritten digit recognition using neural network, trained on `60000` images from `MNIST dataset`.
## Getting Started

This example is only based on the python library ```keras``` to implement convolutional layers, maxpooling layers and fully-connected layers, also including backpropagation and gradients descent to train the network and cross entropy to evaluate the loss.

## Running the Codes
installing the requirements.
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
# Requirements

* Python 3.5 +
* Keras (latest version)
* Numpy (+ mkl for Windows)
